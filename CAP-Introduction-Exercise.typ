= Task Description

Develop a comprehensive full-stack university management application using SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) that serves as a centralized system for managing academic operations. The application will handle the organization of academic programs (studies), course modules, and student enrollment in a structured and efficient manner.

This enterprise-grade solution will provide:

- *Study Program Management:* Organize and maintain different study programs (degrees) with their associated requirements including credits needed for completion, program duration, and curriculum structure

- *Module Catalog Management:* Define and manage course modules offered across study programs, including credit values, weights, validity periods, mandatory/elective status, exam options, and assignment tracking

- *Student Management:* Track students throughout their academic journey, managing their enrollment in study programs and registration for specific modules, maintaining comprehensive student records including personal information and academic progress

- *Module Assignment Tracking:* Enable students to register for available modules and manage their course selections, while enforcing business rules around module availability, prerequisites, and study program requirements

- *No Worries:* We won't implement all of this ;)

The system establishes clear relationships between Students, Studies (degree programs), and Modules, allowing for flexible curriculum design while maintaining data integrity and providing students with a personalized view of their academic path.

== Helpful Links
While working on the task, feel free to use the following documentations as much as possible. Especially the CAP Documentation is really powerful.

= Data Model

Use below diagram as a reference to design your CAP entities.

  #image("files/intro-exercise/entity-diagram.png", width: 80%)
]

#pagebreak()

= Implementation

== Initialize CAP Application

Initialize your CAP application with the following command in the terminal either in VS Code or BAS:

```bash
cds init university
cd university
```

== Project Structure

Your project structure should look like this:

#align(center)[
  #image("files/intro-exercise/project-structure.png", width: 30%)
]

== File Structure Setup

Create the database schema file in `/db/`:
- `schema.cds`

Create service definition files in `/srv/`:
- `students-service.cds`
- `studies-service.cds`
- `catalog-service.cds`

== Create Data Models

Create the data models in the `/db` flder based on the entity diagram. You can have a look at the #link-blue("https://pages.github.tools.sap/cap/docs/cds/cdl", "CDL documentation") for reference.

#hint-block[
  *Hint:* If you are stuck with the creation of the data model, please raise your hand. We are happy to help you.
]

== Create Example Data

Generate schema with example data:

```bash
cds add data --records 10
```

== Test Data Models

Test if your data models are defined correctly and no compilation errors occur (You can leave this command running while working on the next steps):

```bash
cds watch
```
Only proceed to the next step if your compilation is successfull, otherwise have a closer look at your data model. In case you make changes to your model, you also may need to delete the `db/data` folder and recreate the example data.
== Create Services

Create the services in the `/srv/` folder, which expose the entities via API. Check out the #link-blue("https://pages.github.tools.sap/cap/docs/cds/services", "documentation") for how to define services.

- The studies service should expose the Studies entity
- The students service should expose the Students entity and the Studies entity. The studies entity can be later used as a value help when creating a new student and assigning them to a study
- In the Students and Studies service enable draft for the respective entities to allow them being edited
- In the Catalog service expose the Modules entity as well as the ModuleAssignments entity, to show a list of modules students can sign up for

== Add Actions

Actions allow to define POST endpoints, which execute some logic when being called. Follow the #link-blue("https://pages.github.tools.sap/cap/docs/cds/services#actions", "docs") to add a bound action "assign" to the Modules. Do not add an implementation for that yet. We will do that later.

== Create UI Applications

Create UI applications by using the Fiori Frontend Generator.

#hint-block[
  *Note:* You should repeat this step for each OData service, in total 3 times.
]

+ In the menu click *View → Command Palette* (Ctrl + Shift + P) and start typing "Fiori" and select *Fiori: Open CF Application Generator*

+ Select *List Report Page* in the template section and click "Next"

#align(center)[
  #image("files/intro-exercise/fiori-generator.png", width: 80%)
]

+ In *Data Source* select "Use a Local CAP Project":
  - Choose a CAP Project: `university`
  - OData Service: `YourService`

+ In the *Entity Selection* select:
  - Main Entity: `YourMainEntityOfTheService`
  - Navigation Entity: `YourNavigationEntity` (If applicable)
  - Automatically add table columns to the list page and a section to the object page if none already exists: *Yes*
  - Table Type: *Responsive*

+ In the *Project Attributes* select:
  - Module Name: e.g. `students-management` for the students-service
  - Application Title: e.g. "Students Management" for the students service
  - Application Namespace: empty
  - Description: `YourDescription`
  - Enable TypeScript: *No*
  - Add Fiori Launchpad Configuration: *Yes*

+ In the *SAP Fiori Launchpad Configuration*:
  - Semantic Object: `YourMainEntityOfTheService`
  - Action: `manage` (or something better fitting)
  - Title: Choose accordingly, will be displayed on the Launchpad tile
  - Subtitle: Choose accordingly, will be displayed on the Launchpad tile

+ Continue creating the Fiori config for the remaining services, once you finished, continue with the next step.

== Define UI Annotations

For defining the UI annotations, you can use the Fiori application modeler plugin (#image("files/intro-exercise/fiori-modeler-icon.png", height: 1em) icon):

- Select the app you want to work on and select the page, e.g. either the list page or the details page
- Afterwards you can configure columns for tables or modify the sections shown on the details page
- *FYI, but not necessary:* You can also manually define the annotations in CDS files. Ideally use the `annotations.cds` file in each `app/` folder to do the annotations for the respective app:
  - `@UI.LineItem` specifies a table definition
  - `@UI.HeaderInfo` specifies the header of an object page as well as the table name
  - `@UI.PresentationVariant` specifies the default sorting for a table
  - `@UI.FieldGroup` specifies a form
  - `@UI.Facets` specifies the sections of an object page. Facets can contain field groups, line items or charts
  - You can check-out the #link-blue("https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html", "Fiori elements showcase") for samples of each annotation
- To disable the "Go" button in the UI add the "liveMode" setting in each applications `webapp/manifest.json` file. For more information, reference to the #link-blue("https://pages.github.tools.sap/cap/docs/advanced/fiori#live-mode", "docs")

== Add Local Launchpad

Add a local launchpad by running the following command:

```bash
npm add -D cds-launchpad-plugin
```

Afterwards usually on localhost, port 4004 a "Sandbox Launchpad" appears, via which you can test the UI apps within the SAP Shell.

#align(center)[
  #image("files/intro-exercise/sandbox-launchpad-link.png", width: 90%)
]
#align(center)[
  #image("files/intro-exercise/sandbox-launchpad.png", width: 90%)
]

== Add Actions to UI

After the creation of the basic UI application, add Buttons to call the assign and unassign actions you created earlier. Again, use the Fiori Tools to open the Page Map of the catalog application or execute the Command *Fiori: Show Page Map* and select the catalog app.

Edit the Object Page:

#align(center)[
  #image("files/intro-exercise/fiori-editor.png", width: 100%)
]

- Under *Header → Actions → + on the right side → Add Actions* → Select the assign action

If you now restart, go to the object page and click assign, you should get an error that an implementation is missing. We will add that later.

== Debug Your Application

You can start your application in debug mode by using a JavaScript Debug Terminal in VSCode and executing `cds watch` there.

== Adding Authorization and Authentication

You now want to restrict the catalog service so that only Students can see it. Read about auth in CAP #link-blue("https://pages.github.tools.sap/cap/docs/guides/authorization", "here").

CAP offers pre-defined mock users. We now want to overwrite one of them to add the role Student to the mock user alice. You can do it like this in your `package.json`:

```json
"cds": {
  "requires": {
    "[development]": {
      "auth": {
        "kind": "mocked",
        "users": {
          "alice": {
            "password": "1234",
            "roles": [
              "Student"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

== Adding Business Logic

Run the following commands to add the TypeScript configuration:

```bash
cds add typescript
npm install
```

Add a `/srv/catalog-service.ts` file. CAP will automatically consider js/ts files with the same name as the service file.

```ts
import cds from '@sap/cds';
import { Module } from '#cds-models/CatalogService'

export class CatalogService extends cds.ApplicationService {
  init() {
    this.on(Module.actions.assign, async req => {
      console.log("Assign called", req.user)
    })
  }
}
```

Implement the assign action that assigns the user to the Module. In case an assignment already exists, do not add one but return an error.

- You can leverage `req.subject` as a shortcut for the information which entity is targeted by the bound action
- You can use `req.user` to gain information about the logged in user
- `req.params` contains the URL parameters like the ID of the bound entity
- Use CAPs SQL like query API to do the necessary statements
- Use `req.info` to let the student know that you assigned them or `req.error` to display the error
- Make use of the debugger to inspect the incoming requests or results from database access
